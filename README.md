# devicon-react-svg

**devicon-react-svg** is an implementation of the **[Devicons](http://vorillaz.github.io/devicons/)** icon library (which contains the logos of various popular programming languages, frameworks and design and development tools) for **React**. 

**devicon-react-svg** returns a functional React component that, when passed the name of a Devicon as the `icon` prop, will render it as an inline SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image.

---
## Installation
To install with **npm**:
```bash
npm install --save devicon-react-svg
```
To install with **Yarn**:
```bash
yarn add devicon-react-svg
```
---
## Usage
Import the default export from **devicon-react-svg** and use it in your JSX as you would any other React component. It accepts the prop `icon`, which should be the name of the Devicon as a string.

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import DevIcon from "devicon-react-svg";

const Demo = props => {
    return (<DevIcon icon="react" />);
}

ReactDOM.render(<Demo/>, document.getElementById('root'));
```
---
You can style the SVG component by passing in a `style` prop or a `viewBox` prop, like this...

```js 
const devIconStyle = {
    fill: "thistle",
    width: "150px",
};

const Demo = props => {
    return (
        <DevIcon icon="react" style={devIconStyle} viewBox="0 0 32 32"/>
        );
}
```
or by using a library like **[styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components)**...

```js 
import styled from "styled-components";

const StyledIcon = styled(DevIcon)`
    fill: thistle;
    width: 150px;
`;

const Demo = props => {
    return (<StyledIcon icon="css3" />);
}
```
---
## Additional exports
A list of the icon names accepted by the component can be found in the [Devicons cheatsheet](http://vorillaz.github.io/devicons/#/cheat), or can be returned as an array by using the package's `iconList` export. **devicon-react-svg** also exports the `RandomIcon` component to display a randomly chosen icon.

```js
import DevIcon, {iconList, RandomIcon} from "devicon-react-svg";

console.log(`Here is a list of icon names used by this component: ${iconList}`);

const Demo = props => {
    return (<RandomIcon />);
}
```

## Credits

**devicon-react-svg** was made by Dennis Hodges, a Javascript developer.

Thank you to [Theodore Vorillas](https://www.vorillaz.com/), who created the font and icon collection that this component is based on, and which is the source of all of the svg path data used in this package.

You can find his original icon repository here: [Devicons](https://github.com/vorillaz/devicons).
